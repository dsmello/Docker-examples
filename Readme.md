# This is a collection of examples of how to conteinerize your code

We'll create the conteinerized code using the Dockerfile on project root. 

*The Dockerfile is the recipe of application* There we'll descripe each step of the build process.
Things like:
- Base image:: The operating system to use. [Ubuntu, Debian, Windows, etc.]
- Environment variables:: The environment variables to use.
- Build instructions:: The commands to execute to build the application.
- Test instructions:: The commands to execute to test the application.
- Run instructions:: The commands to execute to run the application. 

## Languages:

I'll doing this project when I had free time or when I teach a course about docker for new my new teams.
